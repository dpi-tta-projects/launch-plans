1. Select a Focus
Primary Career Path (Current Role): IAM Associate Analyst at UL Solutions → Identity Governance, Access Lifecycle, Compliance, and IT Fundamentals.


Skill Focus
IAM & Cybersecurity (Primary):


Identity & Access Management (Active Directory, RBAC, MFA, SSO).


Identity lifecycle (provisioning, access review, de-provisioning).


Regulatory compliance (SOX, HIPAA, ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-63).


Incident response and IAM KPIs/metrics.




2. State Your "Why"
My immediate goal is to excel in my IAM Analyst role at UL Solutions. By mastering IAM tools, lifecycle management, and compliance frameworks, I’ll become a reliable contributor who can handle access requests, audits, and security incidents with confidence. This role gives me a strong foundation for my long term career outlook in Cybersecurity, hoping to eventually get into Cloud Security down the road given my prior exposure to AWS.

3. Outline My Learning Path
Resources (IAM & Cybersecurity)
NIST Digital Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63) → NIST.gov


Identity Management Institute (IMI) → identitymanagementinstitute.org


Microsoft Learn IAM & Azure AD modules


CompTIA A+ (Professor Messer free resources)


Mentorship & Peers
Connect with Ian for IAM responsibilities and expectations. (Have met with Ian twice so far)


Schedule check-ins with DPI alum at UL Solutions like Brian and Jose to learn from their ramp-up. (Talked with Jose a month ago, learned a lot about UL Solutions as a company and what they expect out of us)


Meet up with Candide prior to start date in order to catch up on how we've been preparing for the role.

Milestone 1 (2 Weeks):


Learn at least one of the key compliance and regulatory frameworks (SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, and ISO 27001) (Feeling comfortable with NIST CSF 2.0)✓
Begin preparing for the CompTIA A+ exam (In Progress, decided to focus on A+ instead of Security+ as I need to build up my IT fundamentals)
Talk to Ian regarding next steps. ✓
Connect with 1–2 DPI alums at UL Solutions for ramp-up advice. ✓


Milestone 2 (4 Weeks):

Milestone 3 (6 Weeks):


Learn the identity lifecycle along with incident response. (In Progress)


Milestone 4 (8 Weeks):


Start learning more about the AI IAM tool Saviynt as that will be used frequently on the job. (In Progress)
Look into Delinea which will be used for storing secrets.

Handle IAM requests end-to-end (provisioning, access review, de-provisioning).


Confidently apply IAM controls: RBAC, MFA, SSO.


Document and explain IAM processes to peers or auditors.


Demonstrate measurable contributions (e.g., reduced ticket resolution time, accurate reporting).



6. Potential Blockers & Strategies
Blockers
Time constraints balancing full-time IAM work and outside learning.



Strategies
Prioritize IAM learning during both weekends and weekdays.


Seek feedback regularly from UL Solutions mentor and DPI alum to stay aligned.
