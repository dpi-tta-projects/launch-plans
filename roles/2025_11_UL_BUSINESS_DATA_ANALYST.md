Launch Plan from October 2025-November Start and Beyond

The team spends 30-40% of the time using Python, another 30-40% on Power BI, including DAX, and the remaining time on Excel. Only 5% of the time uses SQL.
As I am certified in Excel and Power BI, I'm shifting my focus to Python. 
After speaking with my manager, I sent her a link to the Python course I was starting to get her insights on what to focus on.

Per her recommendation, I will be taking courses 1-3, not 4, since we won't use much NumPy.

The following course was also recommended by my manager, and I will be taking it after my DataCamp one: https://www.coursera.org/projects/python101-develop-your-first-python-code. 
The purpose of these courses is for me to get a basic understanding of Python. 

Including a focus on:
Math Operations
Lists
Functions
Loops
Pandas

Things to focus on for my other stacks:
For Excel - VLookup, Pivot Tables
Power BI - DAX

I will revisit Excel concepts on my own through research, and I will retake some of the intermediate DAX courses, as they cover some of the equations I discussed with my manager during our meeting.

Focusing on these items, I feel ready to hit the ground running on Day 1.
